# Library Management System

This demo solution will be use simple concurrent hashmaps to store the books.

Swagger API Documentation : http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

### Running Locally
Default profile runs on port 8081, run the application class LibraryManagementSystemApplication


### Scope for Improvements
* Split stock availability from Books
* Use persistent storage for Books and availability
* Use regex validation for ISBN
* Use API first approach - generate modes and controller api from YAML, if this project involves many third party systems and consumers
* Use formatter and code coverage plugins to fail the build when the required coverage not met
* Enable JWT with springboot security

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
